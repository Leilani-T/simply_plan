When this project is complete, I expect to have a user interface that is flexible in colors/aesthetics for the user. To do this, I would need the SQL backend to work with the other front-end formats of the program. This database will demonstrate time as a visual aspect to enhance productivity. The expected product should be very interactive to the user to provide much information about their assignments and possibly other aspects of life.
